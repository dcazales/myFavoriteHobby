# Sprint One:
 - My favorite hobby: contains infomation about my favorite hobby. Includes images, tables, and external links. It is made of .html file      and .css file. In additon, 8 pictures.  

Most content is original(the idea). However, reference to https://www.w3schools.com/html/ was used throughout ALL projects to style and animate. In addition, I used information, code, and recommendations that was given by my professor, Mr. Pogue.
